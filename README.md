## Usage

Currently this package comes with a single implementation DI container, namely the `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ServiceCollection`.

To use this DI provider, your Visual Studio extension package will need to inherit from the `Community.VisualStudio.Toolkit.DependencyInjection.Microsoft.MicrosoftDIToolkitPackage`.
Doing so provides the `ServiceProvider` property along with the `virtual` method `InitializeServices`.

To register your services in the DI container you will need to override the `InitializeServices` method. 
Once the services have been registered in the collection, they can be retrieved by using the `ServiceProvider` property. 
An example implementation could be:

```csharp
[PackageRegistration(UseManagedResourcesOnly = true, AllowsBackgroundLoading = true)]
[Guid(PackageGuids.DITestExtensionString)]
[ProvideMenuResource("Menus.ctmenu", 1)]
public sealed class TestExtensionPackage : MicrosoftDIToolkitPackage<TestExtensionPackage>
{
    protected override void InitializeServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        // Register your services here
        services.AddSingleton<IYourService, YourService>();

        // Register any commands. They can be registered as a 'Singleton' or 'Scoped'. 
        // 'Transient' will work but in practice it will behave the same as 'Scoped'.
        services.AddSingleton<YourCommand>();

        // Alternatively, you can use the 'RegisterCommands' extension method to automatically register all commands in an assembly.
        services.RegisterCommands(ServiceLifetime.Singleton);
        ...
    }

    protected override async Task InitializeAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken, IProgress<ServiceProgressData> progress)
    {
        // Ensure that you first call the base.InitializeAsync method.
        await base.InitializeAsync(cancellationToken, progress);

        // Your initialization code here
        var yourService = this.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<IYourService>();
        ...
    }
}

```

## Commands
**Note**: Your commands ***MUST*** inherit from the `BaseDICommand` in order for them to work with the dependency injection system.


### Example Command
```csharp
[Command(PackageIds.MyCommand)]
public class MyCommand: BaseDICommand
{
    // This is passed in through the constructor
    private readonly SomeSingletonObject _singletonObject;

    public DependencyInjectionCommand(
        DIToolkitPackage package, 
        SomeSingletonObject singletonObject)
        : base(package)
    {
        this._singletonObject = singletonObject;
    }

    protected async override Task ExecuteAsync(OleMenuCmdEventArgs e)
    {
        // Your execution logic here. This is executed in the context of a new scope.
        ...
    }

    protected override void BeforeQueryStatus(EventArgs e)
    {
        // Your query logic here. This is executed in the context of a new scope.
        ...  
    }
}
```

### Registering Your Commands

You can register your commands in the DI container just like any other service. 
Your commands will be instantiated at the time of invocation and the lifetime with which they were registered will be followed.
For example, if a command was registered as a singleton, then the same instance will be returned every time the command is invoked.
If a command is registered as `Scoped`, then a new instance will be instantiated every time the command is invoked, including when the `BeforeQueryStatus` message is called.

```csharp
protected override void InitializeServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    ... 

    // Register any commands. They can be registered as a 'Singleton' or 'Scoped'. 
    // 'Transient' will work but in practice it will behave the same as 'Scoped'.
    services.AddSingleton<YourCommand>();

    // Alternatively, you can use the 'RegisterCommands' extension method to automatically register all commands in an assembly.
    services.RegisterCommands(ServiceLifetime.Singleton);

    ...
}
```


Every call to the methods on your command use their own scope. 
What that means is that any services retrieved from the DI container will be retrieved from that scoped container.

## Retrieving the `IServiceProvider` from the main VS Service Provider

As part of the initialization process, the DI container is registered into Visual Studio's container as well. 
You can retrieve your custom container using the following:

```csharp
// Retrieve the IServiceProvider
var serviceProvider = await VS.GetServiceAsync<SToolkitServiceProvider<TestExtensionPackage>, IToolkitServiceProvider<TestExtensionPackage>>();

// Retrieve your service from the IServiceProvider
var yourService = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IYourService>();
``` 

## Retrieving your package from the DI container

You can retrieve the instance of your package from the DI container using one of the following:

```csharp
// Retrieve it as your package type
var testExtensionPackage = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<TestExtensionPackage>();

// Retrieve it as the base class type 'AsyncPackage'
var asyncPackage = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<AsyncPackage>();
```

## Additional DI providers
The package has been written to allow additional containers if the need arrises. 
Look at the `MicrosoftDIToolkitPackage` implementation for how to incorporate your own DI container of choice.
